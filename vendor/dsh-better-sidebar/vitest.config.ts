/**
 * Vitest config: inline the npm-published `@deepseek-ai/*` packages whose
 * BUILT lib bundles css side-effect imports (e.g. `dsh-client-ui-primitives`
 * imports `katex/dist/katex.min.css` at the top of its `lib/index.js`).
 *
 * Installed from the npm registry (the default since v0.4.1) these packages
 * live under `node_modules/.pnpm` and are externalized by vitest — Node then
 * chokes on the `.css` import. Inlining routes them through Vite's transform,
 * which stubs css imports (the default `css: false`). The previous
 * `link:`-to-source-checkout install needed no such config: linked files sit
 * outside `node_modules` and are transformed by default.
